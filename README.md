# Nutrition AI
### Problem
According to the CDC, the one-size-fits-all diet approach is inadequate for many individuals as it ignores key factors such as medical conditions, food allergies, and specific dietary goals and preferences.
### Solution
Nutrition AI, a mobile software application that uses machine learning to provide personalized nutrition recommendations based on a user's dietary preferences, health goals, and exercise habits. It aims to solve the one-size-fits-all diet approach problem by providing users with tailored nutrition advice.

Nutrition AI enables users to:
* Easily input their allergies, goals, and habits.
* Enjoy swiping left (no) or right (yes) on meals to train the AI on their preferences.
* Instantly receive tailored nutrition advice such as meal plans and grocery lists based on their input.
* Use 100% of the app for no cost.
