# NutriMind
### Problem
A survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that at least 23% of adults in the United States were following a one-size-fits-all diet approach (CDC, 2018). The one-size-fits-all diet approach assumes that all individuals have the same nutritional needs and that a single diet can be universally applied to all people. A study published in the journal Nutrients found that personalized nutrition advice based on individual factors, including age, sex, body size, activity level, genetics, and underlying health conditions was more effective in promoting weight loss, muscle gain, and improving dietary quality than a one-size-fits-all approach (D'Alessandro et al., 2020).

A survey conducted by the International Food Information Council Foundation found that 58% of respondents were interested in personalized nutrition advice based on their individual needs and preferences (IFIC, 2020). This suggests that there is a growing demand for more personalized nutrition guidance.
### Solution
NutriMind, a mobile software application that uses machine learning to provide personalized nutrition recommendations based on a user's dietary preferences, health goals, and exercise habits. It aims to solve the one-size-fits-all diet approach problem by providing users with tailored nutrition advice.

NutriMind enables users to:
* Easily input their allergies, goals, and habits.
* Enjoy swiping left (no) or right (yes) on meals to train the AI on their preferences.
* Instantly receive tailored nutrition advice such as meal plans and grocery lists based on their input.
* Use 100% of the app for no cost.

## Getting Started
### How To Start Working On An Issue
1. Update the Project Board
    * Open [Project Board](https://github.com/users/nathan-wick/projects/3/views/1)
    * Find the issue you wish to work on from the `Ready` column
    * Assign yourself to the issue
    * Drag the issue from the `Ready` column to the `In progress` column
2. Clone the Repository (if you haven't already)
    * Open Visual Studio Code
    * Open a terminal at the folder you'd like to store the project in
    * Type the command `git clone https://github.com/nathan-wick/nutrition-ai.git`
    * Press `Enter` to run the command
3. Create a New Branch
    * Open Visual Studio Code
    * Open a terminal at the repository's root
    * Type the command `git checkout -b branchName dev`
    * Replace `branchName` with the issue number (For example, a branch for issue #42 would be named `42`)
    * Press `Enter` to run the command
### How To Finish Working On An Issue
1. Commit and push your changes
    * Open Visual Studio Code
    * Open a terminal at the repository's root
    * Type the command `git commit -m "description"`
    * Replace `description` with a very short description of the changes you have made (For example, if you updated the README, a good description would be `Update README`)
    * Press `Enter` to run the command
    * Type the command `git push`
    * Press `Enter` to run the command

2. Create a pull request
    * Open [Pull Requests](https://github.com/nathan-wick/nutrition-ai/pulls)
    * Press `New pull request`
    * Compare the issue's branch to the `dev` branch
    * Verify the changes shown are correct and solve any merge conflicts
    * Write a description that contains `Closes #issueNumber` where `issueNumber` is replaced with the issue's number
    * Request review from at least one other teammate
    * Assign yourself to the pull request
    * Submit the pull request

3. Update the Project Board
    * Open [Project Board](https://github.com/users/nathan-wick/projects/3/views/1)
    * Find the issue you worked on from the `In progress` column
    * Drag the issue from the `In progress` column to the `In review` column
